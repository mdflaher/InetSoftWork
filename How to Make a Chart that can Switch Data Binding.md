# How do I make a chart that switches data bindings back and forth?

This [radio button example](https://www.inetsoft.com/public/app/viewer/view/global/Dashboards/radio%20button) example uses the orders dataset. Drag out a chart and radio button from the left hand panel.

Select the radio button so it is highlighed in orange as shown. Drag out dimensions 'Salesperson:First Name' and 'Customer:Company' into the radio button. Click on the orange squares on either side of the highlighed radio button to stretch the element to a width necessary to show its labels.

Click on the 'Edit' button in the center of the chart. If the Visualization Reccomender appears, select 'Full Editor'.

In full Chart Editor, drag 'Order:Paid' into the x axis. It should default as a sum.

Click on the button with an F and X on it next to where 'Salesperson:First Name' was dragged into the y axis. Select 'Variable' in the dropdown that appears. The space for the y axis should now display '$(Radiobutton1)' or whatever name you gave the radio button.

Click 'Finish'. You now have a [chart](https://www.inetsoft.com/public/app/viewer/view/global/Dashboards/radio%20button) that defaults as orders by salesperson.

# How can I let the end user select any data binding?

InetSoft charts as a default have an edit button which allows the end user to open up the chart binding and swap in any fields they want or change aggregations.

If you'd rather not leave this functionality open to your end users, right click on the chart and select 'Properties'.

Click on the 'Advanced' tab. You can now check or uncheck 'Enable Ad Hoc editing' to enable or disable the feature for end users.
